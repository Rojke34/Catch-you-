# Catch-you-
The worst idea XD download video, convert to text, search keywords (from YouTube) backend I lost it

I just created a backend using Node.js 
The Idea was

1. Generate a random YouTube video Id 
2. On server dowload it
3. Convert the video to text
4. Search for keywords and with luck find someting necesary
